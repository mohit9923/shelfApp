Use Java JDK 17 to run this project on your system.

If you simply want to run the app, you can try installing the apk directly: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KLnN7xg32mfHrjGvD3VyuUb2uyhhHRTj/view?usp=sharing

While installation, you may be prompted with this popup:

You need to select "Install Anyway" button to let the apk install on your mobile device.

After the app has been installed, you can sign up as a new user or use 1 email password combination, which I created for testing purpose:

email: tester@gmail.com,
password: 1Tester@99
